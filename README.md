This is dataset Yago-Animal-143, which contains the semantic relatedness 
of 143 pairs of common animal names (92 different animals) including 
mammals, birds, insects and marine animals.

The relatedness score of each pair has been evaluated by 9 persons, and 
the average is used as the human judgement. The range of score is from 
0 to 3. For instance, the score between antelope and swan should probably 
be 0, and the score between cattle and bison can be 3.

This dataset was proposed in our ACL workshop paper 
"Joint Semantic Relevance Learning with Text Data and Graph Knowledge"
